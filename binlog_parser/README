A small C program and wrapper script that will trace any DELETE happening 
on a master server into a separate table. Useful to track rows deleted 
that often go unnoticed when populating a BI platform using the usual
methods.

The binary logs are examined at regular intervals and any DELETE that involves
one of the configured tables is tracked into a separate table, including
the table schema and name and the where statement.

If using with galera cluster, install and run the script and program on
all nodes, it will only do its work on the node that is current master.
